# @plurnk/plurnk-mimetypes

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8d9fb11: `HandlerInfo.attribution` is removed; discovery's `packageAttributions` carries
  every package's tags. The `./conformance` exports `QueryLineCase`,
  `QueryConformanceHandler` and `assertQueryLineConformance` are removed.

### Patch Changes

- 06960fc: Diagnostics across the stack say what happened, never why. A refusal names what
  was read, what was done with it and where, and recovers with the construct's
  working form; rebuilt scopes, suggested operations, presumed causes and
  migration hints for retired forms are gone.

## 2.0.0

- Retire family-wide dependency freshness scanning; packages declare independent compatibility.
- Preserve ANTLR missing-token recovery nodes without fabricating exact source coordinates.

### Major Changes

- Establish the coordinated 2.0 baseline and independent package versioning. From
  this release onward, each package follows its own SemVer contract; compatible
  unchanged dependencies no longer force synchronized releases. Library and
  extension dependencies declare compatible ranges, while the service records its
  assembled dependency selection. Exact tested compositions accompany releases.

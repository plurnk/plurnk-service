# Plurnk A2A specification

## §a2a-http-json-discovery HTTP+JSON discovery

`connectHttpJsonAgent` discovers the standard A2A Agent Card, selects an
advertised `HTTP+JSON` interface at protocol version `1.0`, and returns the
official SDK client. An explicit Agent Card path may replace the standard
well-known path. No legacy protocol or alternate binding is enabled.

## §a2a-protocol-witness Protocol witness

The integration witness places a discovery-first client and an independent
agent on opposite sides of the official A2A v1 HTTP+JSON binding. It covers
card discovery, blocking task completion, task retrieval, ordered streaming
updates, artifacts, and cancellation. The independent agent may use the SDK's
reference request handler and task store; those test actors are not the Plurnk
task architecture.

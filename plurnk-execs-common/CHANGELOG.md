# @plurnk/plurnk-execs-common

## 3.0.4

### Patch Changes

- Canonicalize Heredoc Code Mode (`<<<EOF`) across parser, serializer, teaching, and contracts, unify operation payloads on `{ text }` while retiring stream `metadata` and `lifetime` fields, remove `PLURNK_SERVICE_PROMPT_PREVIEW` and `PLURNK_SERVICE_LOG_BUDGET_SUMMARY`, add OAuth 2.1 `requested_subject` token exchange and principal-scoped ACP v2 live streams, emit ACP v2 `_plurnk_telemetry`, windowed session resume, multi-select `question` options, and paginated `log.list` / `log.read` (`openOnly`, `sender`, `recipient`, `offset`), extract EXIF headers in `@plurnk/plurnk-mimetypes-image`, and lower the packet token floor to `~2,948` (#1412 #1419 #1420 #1421 #1422 #1423 #1424 #1425 #1426 #1427 #1428 #1429 #1430 #1431 #1432 #1433 #1434 #1435 #1436 #1437 #1438 #1439).
  
  ### Operator Migration Guide (5.x to 6.0.0)
  
  - **Upgrade client and daemon together:** Upgrade `@plurnk/plurnk` and `@plurnk/plurnk-service` to `6.0.0`.
  - **SQLite Schema Migrations (`015`–`018`, `{§db-migrations}`):** Chapters `015_session_message_keys.sql` (`session_messages` composite foreign keys and cascade deletes), `016_drop_unused_columns.sql` (retiring unused `streams.metadata`, `streams.lifetime`, `sessions.CompactionSummary`, `sessions.CompactionThroughLoop`, and `turns.parse_advisory` columns), `017_pending_derivation_indexes.sql` (partial indexes for incremental `SearchIndex.maintain`), and `018_content_dedup_payloads.sql` (interning `turn_sources` and `log_entries` payloads into `contents`) run automatically in place on any database at or above the `5.0.0` support floor (`user_version >= 11`).
  - **Removed Configuration Knobs (`{§configuration-panel}`):** `PLURNK_SERVICE_PROMPT_PREVIEW` and `PLURNK_SERVICE_LOG_BUDGET_SUMMARY` are retired; remove them from `.env` files if present.
  - **Model-Facing Heredoc Syntax (`{§code-grammar}`):** Canonical Code Mode emits `await`-free `<service>.<tool>({ ... })` calls with `<<<EOF` heredoc delimiters for multiline values, and `note`, `send`, `work`, `fork`, `done`, `fail`, and `kill` carry their body in `text`.

## 3.0.3

### Patch Changes

- Replace the fenced heading grammar with exclusive unwrapped Code Mode
  (`await plurnk.<op>(args);` and `await <server>.<tool>(args);`), unify the 15
  core VM operations, REPL executors (`sh`, `js`, `python3`), 6 Functionality
  families (`env`, `mcp`, `members`, `personas`, `schedule`, `skills`), and
  `question` under the `plurnk` MCP runtime (`mcp:///plurnk.md`,
  `mcp:///plurnk/*.json`), lowercase operation tokens across contracts, parser,
  engine, SQLite (`014_lowercase_ops.sql`), ACPv2, and digest, consolidate Plurnk
  Harness reference chapters under `skill://plurnk/*.md` and `mcp:///*.md` Turn-0
  orientation with a single closing `todo` (`~3,097` wire token floor), and
  delegate OpenAI-compatible `compat` and stream normalization to
  `@mariozechner/pi-ai` with an in-flight runaway stream output allowance guard
  (#1403 #1404 #1405 #1406 #1407 #1408 #1409 #1410 #1411 #1413 #1414 #1415 #1416 #1417 #1418).

## 3.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 39a8617: Delegate model catalog discovery and provider streaming directly to
  `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (`#1286`, `#1305`), restrict `service.update` to model
  catalog refresh (`#1285`), allow trusted third-party
  `@plurnk/plurnk-mimetypes-*` packages to override built-in floor handlers
  (`#1306`), keep ACP streams alive with `heartbeatMs` and restore
  disconnect/gate-transfer integration coverage (`#1307`, `#1308`), unify
  `ApplicationPort` and domain modules (`#1287`–`#1304`, `#1312`), enforce
  heading-only `§tag` declarations and dual witnesses in `plurnk-spec-check`
  (`#1283`, `#1309`, `#1311`), and complete ACP v2, MCP v2 Open Work, SEP-2640
  Skills over MCP, and multi-tier customization parity (`#654`, `#1332`–`#1351`).
  
  ### Operator Migration Guide (4.x to 5.0.0)
  
  - **SQLite Schema Baseline ({§db-migrations}):** 34 incremental chapters
    (`user_version = 34` in `v4.3.3`) are folded into an 11-chapter baseline
    (`001`–`011`, `user_version = 11`) with a support-floor guard. Point
    `PLURNK_SERVICE_DB_PATH` at a new file or move the pre-5.0 database and its
    `-wal` and `-shm` sidecars aside once every daemon holding it has stopped.
  - **Session & Workspace Addressing ({§session-scheme}):** `worker://<name>` is
    renamed to `session://<name>`, `workspace:///` holds shared workspace scratch
    entries, and `plurnk:///` and `mcp:///` serve generated daemon, tool, and MCP
    server reference documents. Update references from `worker://` to `session://`
    and `_plurnk/...` to `plurnk:///...` or `mcp:///...`.
  - **Client & External Protocols ({§acp-daemon-client}):** A2A (`plurnk-a2a`) and
    AG-UI (`plurnk-agui`) are retired in favor of ACP v2 (`/acp` via
    `@plurnk/plurnk-acp`) and OAuth 2.1 (`@plurnk/plurnk-auth`). Upgrade
    `@plurnk/plurnk` to `5.0.0`.
  - **Built-in Executors ({§executor-role}) & Family Tools ({§functionality-model-projection}):**
    `@plurnk/plurnk-execs-jq` and `@plurnk/plurnk-execs-sqlite` are retired, the
    `node` runtime tag is renamed to `js` (`js:///`, `PLURNK_EXECS_JS*`), and the
    multiplexed `plurnk` tool is split into per-family runtimes (`plurnk_env`,
    `plurnk_mcp`, `plurnk_skills`, `plurnk_schedule`, `plurnk_members`, and
    `plurnk_question (ask)`) with flat `add`/`replace` payloads and underscore-bearing
    `RUNTIME_TAG` / `SERVER_NAME` support.
  - **Operation Metadata Matchers:** `[pattern]`, `[env]`, `[cwd]`, and `[args]`
    metadata fields on operations are removed (`#1255`, `#1258`, `#1259`,
    `#1260`). Use the header `pattern` slot, `plurnk_env`, and in-body command
    arguments.
  - **Catalog Refresh (`service.update`):** Narrowed to refreshing the Models.dev
    and `@opencode-ai/models` catalog (`#1285`). Upgrade `@plurnk/*` packages via
    your package manager.
  - **Customization & Environment Cascade:** Adds `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agents` and
    `~/.agents` global roots, `AGENTS.md` + `AGENTS.local.md` across
    global/root/subtrees, `session://<session>/AGENTS.md` role seeding,
    `persona://` (`--persona` / `/persona` / `PLURNK_PERSONAS*`), and
    `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/plurnk/.env.local`.
- Updated dependencies [39a8617]
  - @plurnk/plurnk-contracts@7.0.0

## 3.0.1

### Patch Changes

- f7e3b0e: The card's FIND example says its range pages results, not lines. The `sh`
  page says a receipt names the working directory, relative to the project root,
  only when the command ran elsewhere.

## 3.0.0

- **Breaking:** `sh` follows the environment's executable absolute `SHELL`,
  otherwise `/bin/sh`. Inline commands and script targets use the same
  resolved shell, advertised with its program/version/path.
- Runtime declarations use the public `runtimesModule` entry.
- The shell reference names the packet's Open Work section.
- Uses execs 4.0.

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 143eb55: Treat a command's exit code as its answer: a subprocess that exits resolves
  200 with its `exitCode`, zero or not, with no Problem, so a failing test run or
  a `grep` that matched nothing no longer appears in Errors. A process ended by
  a signal nobody sent it is a `terminated-by-signal` failure.
  
  Report a failed execution once: its status and Problem ride one conclusion
  row, and its other channel rows are plain reads. A stream stopped by its
  holder's own KILL concludes 200 instead of a 499 cancellation; a cancellation
  the holder did not ask for keeps its 499. A tool named as a shell command is
  core's `404 program-is-a-tool` receipt.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 85bcf56: Bind worker approvals to durable owners, inherited by child workers. Client
  attachments declare their supported interaction tools; reconnecting owners can
  resume pending approvals. Explicit control attachment may claim runtime-owned
  work but does not silently transfer another client's ownership.
  
  Replace per-loop proposal and attendance policy with server approval settings
  and owner capabilities. A2A contexts now descend from `PLURNK_A2A_PARENT_WORKER`
  (default `_plurnk`); `PLURNK_A2A_PROPOSALS` is retired. Schedule definitions no
  longer accept loop policy. Existing databases upgrade in place.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Establish the coordinated 2.0 baseline and independent package versioning. From
  this release onward, each package follows its own SemVer contract; compatible
  unchanged dependencies no longer force synchronized releases. Library and
  extension dependencies declare compatible ranges, while the service records its
  assembled dependency selection. Exact tested compositions accompany releases.

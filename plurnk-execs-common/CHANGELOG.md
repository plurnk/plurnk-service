# @plurnk/plurnk-execs-common

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 85bcf56: Bind worker approvals to durable owners, inherited by child workers. Client
  attachments declare their supported interaction tools; reconnecting owners can
  resume pending approvals. Explicit control attachment may claim runtime-owned
  work but does not silently transfer another client's ownership.
  
  Replace per-loop proposal and attendance policy with server approval settings
  and owner capabilities. A2A contexts now descend from `PLURNK_A2A_PARENT_WORKER`
  (default `_plurnk`); `PLURNK_A2A_PROPOSALS` is retired. Schedule definitions no
  longer accept loop policy. Existing databases upgrade in place.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Establish the coordinated 2.0 baseline and independent package versioning. From
  this release onward, each package follows its own SemVer contract; compatible
  unchanged dependencies no longer force synchronized releases. Library and
  extension dependencies declare compatible ranges, while the service records its
  assembled dependency selection. Exact tested compositions accompany releases.

# @plurnk/plurnk-schemes

## 3.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 39a8617: Delegate model catalog discovery and provider streaming directly to
  `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (`#1286`, `#1305`), restrict `service.update` to model
  catalog refresh (`#1285`), allow trusted third-party
  `@plurnk/plurnk-mimetypes-*` packages to override built-in floor handlers
  (`#1306`), keep ACP streams alive with `heartbeatMs` and restore
  disconnect/gate-transfer integration coverage (`#1307`, `#1308`), unify
  `ApplicationPort` and domain modules (`#1287`–`#1304`, `#1312`), enforce
  heading-only `§tag` declarations and dual witnesses in `plurnk-spec-check`
  (`#1283`, `#1309`, `#1311`), and complete ACP v2, MCP v2 Open Work, SEP-2640
  Skills over MCP, and multi-tier customization parity (`#654`, `#1332`–`#1351`).
  
  ### Operator Migration Guide (4.x to 5.0.0)
  
  - **SQLite Schema Baseline ({§db-migrations}):** 34 incremental chapters
    (`user_version = 34` in `v4.3.3`) are folded into an 11-chapter baseline
    (`001`–`011`, `user_version = 11`) with a support-floor guard. Point
    `PLURNK_SERVICE_DB_PATH` at a new file or move the pre-5.0 database and its
    `-wal` and `-shm` sidecars aside once every daemon holding it has stopped.
  - **Session & Workspace Addressing ({§session-scheme}):** `worker://<name>` is
    renamed to `session://<name>`, `workspace:///` holds shared workspace scratch
    entries, and `plurnk:///` and `mcp:///` serve generated daemon, tool, and MCP
    server reference documents. Update references from `worker://` to `session://`
    and `_plurnk/...` to `plurnk:///...` or `mcp:///...`.
  - **Client & External Protocols ({§acp-daemon-client}):** A2A (`plurnk-a2a`) and
    AG-UI (`plurnk-agui`) are retired in favor of ACP v2 (`/acp` via
    `@plurnk/plurnk-acp`) and OAuth 2.1 (`@plurnk/plurnk-auth`). Upgrade
    `@plurnk/plurnk` to `5.0.0`.
  - **Built-in Executors ({§executor-role}) & Family Tools ({§functionality-model-projection}):**
    `@plurnk/plurnk-execs-jq` and `@plurnk/plurnk-execs-sqlite` are retired, the
    `node` runtime tag is renamed to `js` (`js:///`, `PLURNK_EXECS_JS*`), and the
    multiplexed `plurnk` tool is split into per-family runtimes (`plurnk_env`,
    `plurnk_mcp`, `plurnk_skills`, `plurnk_schedule`, `plurnk_members`, and
    `plurnk_question (ask)`) with flat `add`/`replace` payloads and underscore-bearing
    `RUNTIME_TAG` / `SERVER_NAME` support.
  - **Operation Metadata Matchers:** `[pattern]`, `[env]`, `[cwd]`, and `[args]`
    metadata fields on operations are removed (`#1255`, `#1258`, `#1259`,
    `#1260`). Use the header `pattern` slot, `plurnk_env`, and in-body command
    arguments.
  - **Catalog Refresh (`service.update`):** Narrowed to refreshing the Models.dev
    and `@opencode-ai/models` catalog (`#1285`). Upgrade `@plurnk/*` packages via
    your package manager.
  - **Customization & Environment Cascade:** Adds `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agents` and
    `~/.agents` global roots, `AGENTS.md` + `AGENTS.local.md` across
    global/root/subtrees, `session://<session>/AGENTS.md` role seeding,
    `persona://` (`--persona` / `/persona` / `PLURNK_PERSONAS*`), and
    `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/plurnk/.env.local`.

## 3.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f136f9: `Results.failure` is typed with the fields it was given: `SchemeResult & F`
  when fields are passed, `SchemeResult` otherwise.

### Patch Changes

- 22ec9ca: A result range of neither one nor two positions is refused naming
  `requestedPositions` as written and no extent ({§range-extent}).
- 19df83f: Specifications: every extension handler states its contract in a shipped
  `SPEC.md`; READMEs reduced to usage; new tags for the aliases cascade, the
  result-shape guards, the card read per wake and the llama-server effort posture.

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3e3e2f4: A settled file mutation's log row keeps the unified diff of what it did: an
  accepted EDIT, COPY, MOVE or KILL that writes or removes a text member appends
  `current` to `proposed` to `log_entries.patch` (migration 28), served as the
  row's `patch` channel (`log:///<loop>/<turn>/<item>/<OP>#patch`, `text/x-diff`)
  for the life of the row and copied by a fork. A byte write, a member past the
  materialization bound, and a row settled before this version keep none, and a
  reader meets no channel rather than an invented one.

## 3.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 7163937: Document existing failure codes omitted from the owning specifications. Runtime
  behavior and failure identities are unchanged.
- 8f3ed44: Preserve the source type when COPY or MOVE creates a channel at an untyped
  destination, including binary files with unknown or absent extensions. Retain
  existing and declared channel types and recognized destination-extension
  compatibility checks through proposal review, publication, and unchanged-source
  reprojection.
  Allow a dynamically typed default channel beside explicitly typed sibling channels.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e0a3b2: The environment registry is an address space, the env family's own face: every
  name in effect for a Worker's commands is a resource at `env:///NAME` whose body
  is its value, so FIND lists it, READ shows it, COPY carries it into a file or an
  entry, EDIT sets it and KILL retires it. Writes land on the Worker's own layer,
  never the workspace's or the operator's: EDIT is the family's `add` for the
  Worker, KILL its `remove` for an entry the Worker owns and its `disable` for one
  it inherited. A reserved name is refused as it is at `add`. A runtime scheme
  facet may now own writable resources: `RuntimeSchemeFacet` takes `editBatch` and
  states `writableBy` in its manifest, and the writer gate reads the manifest that
  governs the coordinate.
- 7a678da: Replay each turn of the loop as the NOTEs it wrote, in the model's own voice:
  one assistant message between the turn's emission record and its results,
  holding every content NOTE whole and in order. Every other operation is omitted;
  its receipt in the log is its record and the program stays readable at `ops://`.
  A replayed turn's emission row carries the legend of its NOTEs, one numbered
  line per NOTE with its `log:///` path and weight, and those NOTE rows render
  nowhere else; retiring a NOTE row retires it from the replay too. A turn that is
  not replayed, an earlier loop or a program omitted at the wall, shows its NOTEs
  as ordinary rows: a NOTE's text is in the packet once, as replay or as row.
  Preserve native attachments, cache-prefix stability, capacity accounting, and
  historical request roles.
  
  Expose message roles in packet section drafts. Preserve retained packet sections
  and their content-addressed items when upgrading the database.
  
  Add a readable, ordered request artifact and show each turn's input role
  sequence in the digest, distinguishing assistant input history from newly
  emitted output.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8d9fb11: Exports kept only for earlier consumers are removed: the `EditStatement` alias,
  the `SubscriptionCaps.notifyChunk` and `close` forwarders (the subscription
  `open` returns carries both), and `SchemeInfo.attribution` (discovery's
  `packageAttributions` carries every package's tags).

### Patch Changes

- 06960fc: Diagnostics across the stack say what happened, never why. A refusal names what
  was read, what was done with it and where, and recovers with the construct's
  working form; rebuilt scopes, suggested operations, presumed causes and
  migration hints for retired forms are gone.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Establish the coordinated 2.0 baseline and independent package versioning. From
  this release onward, each package follows its own SemVer contract; compatible
  unchanged dependencies no longer force synchronized releases. Library and
  extension dependencies declare compatible ranges, while the service records its
  assembled dependency selection. Exact tested compositions accompany releases.

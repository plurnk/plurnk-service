# @plurnk/plurnk-schemes

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8d9fb11: Exports kept only for earlier consumers are removed: the `EditStatement` alias,
  the `SubscriptionCaps.notifyChunk` and `close` forwarders (the subscription
  `open` returns carries both), and `SchemeInfo.attribution` (discovery's
  `packageAttributions` carries every package's tags).

### Patch Changes

- 06960fc: Diagnostics across the stack say what happened, never why. A refusal names what
  was read, what was done with it and where, and recovers with the construct's
  working form; rebuilt scopes, suggested operations, presumed causes and
  migration hints for retired forms are gone.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Establish the coordinated 2.0 baseline and independent package versioning. From
  this release onward, each package follows its own SemVer contract; compatible
  unchanged dependencies no longer force synchronized releases. Library and
  extension dependencies declare compatible ranges, while the service records its
  assembled dependency selection. Exact tested compositions accompany releases.

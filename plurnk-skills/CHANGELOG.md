# @plurnk/plurnk-skills

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 69f3ffe: A family's `discover` advertises only the inputs it serves. An adapter declares
  `discovery.inputs` (and `emptyListsAll`), implements `discover` exactly when it
  does, and the coordinator builds the discover input schema from that
  declaration: any other input is refused 400 `arguments-invalid` by the shared
  schema check, naming the field. A family without discovery has no `discover`
  verb; MCP serves one only while `PLURNK_MCP_REGISTRY_URL` names a registry, and
  contains an invalid registry setting. Members discovery takes `query` alone and
  refuses a query naming no path or pattern as `query-invalid`; an empty env
  discovery is the whole catalog and needs no body. The refusals
  `query-unsupported`, `configuration-unsupported`, `source-unsupported`,
  `registry-not-configured`, `query-required` and schedule's `source-required`
  are gone.

### Patch Changes

- 06960fc: Diagnostics across the stack say what happened, never why. A refusal names what
  was read, what was done with it and where, and recovers with the construct's
  working form; rebuilt scopes, suggested operations, presumed causes and
  migration hints for retired forms are gone.
- 8d9fb11: Retired names, settings and shapes are erased; nothing recognizes them to refuse
  or translate them. A setting the package does not read is inert, and an
  undeclared value fails through the package's ordinary check.
- 8d9fb11: Model-facing documents describe a proposal as reviewed by the worker's owner
  unless `PLURNK_SERVICE_PROPOSALS` accepts or rejects it.
- 503ea87: A `PLURNK_*` key the operator's configuration file sets and no installed package
  declares is named at startup and by `config check`; nothing is refused.
  Each package panel declares the key families it reads by computed name, such as
  `# PLURNK_MCP_<alias>=<definition>`.
- 85bcf56: Bind worker approvals to durable owners, inherited by child workers. Client
  attachments declare their supported interaction tools; reconnecting owners can
  resume pending approvals. Explicit control attachment may claim runtime-owned
  work but does not silently transfer another client's ownership.
  
  Replace per-loop proposal and attendance policy with server approval settings
  and owner capabilities. A2A contexts now descend from `PLURNK_A2A_PARENT_WORKER`
  (default `_plurnk`); `PLURNK_A2A_PROPOSALS` is retired. Schedule definitions no
  longer accept loop policy. Existing databases upgrade in place.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Move Skills ownership to `@plurnk/plurnk-skills` and reporting to
  `@plurnk/plurnk-digest`. The service no longer exports `Skill`, `/digest`, or
  `/share`. Reporting consumers import the named `Digest` and `Share` exports from
  `@plurnk/plurnk-digest` and supply `openEvidence: EvidenceReader.open`, with
  `EvidenceReader` imported from `@plurnk/plurnk-service/evidence`.

  Rename `PLURNK_SERVICE_SKILLS_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS` to
  `PLURNK_SKILLS_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`, and `PLURNK_SERVICE_REQUIEM_MAX_TOKENS` and
  `PLURNK_SERVICE_REQUIEM_RETRY_MAX_TOKENS` to `PLURNK_DIGEST_REQUIEM_MAX_TOKENS`
  and `PLURNK_DIGEST_REQUIEM_RETRY_MAX_TOKENS`. Retired names are rejected rather
  than maintained as aliases. The CLI's `share` command remains unchanged, and
  existing databases are upgraded in place.
- Establish the coordinated 2.0 baseline and independent package versioning. From
  this release onward, each package follows its own SemVer contract; compatible
  unchanged dependencies no longer force synchronized releases. Library and
  extension dependencies declare compatible ranges, while the service records its
  assembled dependency selection. Exact tested compositions accompany releases.

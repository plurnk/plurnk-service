## 3.0.4

### Patch Changes

- f320b9b: `FunctionalityPrepared` gains a required synchronous `publish()` returning an
  undo. Candidate state goes live there, inside the coordinator's registry
  commit, with no I/O; `commit()` is post-publication settlement; `abort()`
  discards an unpublished candidate. The coordinator composes the adapter's undo
  with its own view rollback. MCP consumes a pending OAuth candidate at publish,
  so a callback replayed after publication is `404 oauth-not-pending` with no
  window (#1155).

  - @plurnk/plurnk-contracts@5.0.0

## 3.0.3

- Honor host cancellation during preparation and join cleanup before shutdown
  disposal. Real preparation and cleanup failures remain visible.
- Uses contracts/modules 4.0.

## 3.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 157cf8f: A members definition is its glob. `members (add)` takes `{"files": ["<glob>",
  "!<glob>"]}` and admits each glob as one definition, all or none, with a receipt
  listing them; `enable`, `disable` and `remove` take `{"file": "<glob>"}`; the
  family serves no `replace`. The operator's `PLURNK_MEMBERS_<alias>=<glob>` key
  is the definition's provenance, shown by `list`. Migration 27 re-keys workspace
  definitions by their glob and drops alias-keyed overrides of service
  definitions. The coordinator gains one seam, `addressing`: a family may name
  definitions by their content, `admit` may return one admission per definition,
  `FunctionalityPreparation.admissions` carries them, and
  `FunctionalityMutationResult` lists `definitions` for such an add. Every file
  miss recovery names the `members (add)` body the family accepts.

## 3.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 0b7f8b1: Add shared named definition replacement, retaining enabledness and preserving
  the previous publication on refusal. Use it for repeated environment EDITs
  and explicit child environment overrides, and reject fresh skill preparation
  failures when their definitions change. Carry attempt-local admission data
  through preparation without changing live state; schedule replacements and
  retries affect timers and held delivery failures only after publication.
- 7163937: Document existing failure codes omitted from the owning specifications. Runtime
  behavior and failure identities are unchanged.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 69f3ffe: A family's `discover` advertises only the inputs it serves. An adapter declares
  `discovery.inputs` (and `emptyListsAll`), implements `discover` exactly when it
  does, and the coordinator builds the discover input schema from that
  declaration: any other input is refused 400 `arguments-invalid` by the shared
  schema check, naming the field. A family without discovery has no `discover`
  verb; MCP serves one only while `PLURNK_MCP_REGISTRY_URL` names a registry, and
  contains an invalid registry setting. Members discovery takes `query` alone and
  refuses a query naming no path or pattern as `query-invalid`; an empty env
  discovery is the whole catalog and needs no body. The refusals
  `query-unsupported`, `configuration-unsupported`, `source-unsupported`,
  `registry-not-configured`, `query-required` and schedule's `source-required`
  are gone.
- 85bcf56: Bind worker approvals to durable owners, inherited by child workers. Client
  attachments declare their supported interaction tools; reconnecting owners can
  resume pending approvals. Explicit control attachment may claim runtime-owned
  work but does not silently transfer another client's ownership.
  
  Replace per-loop proposal and attendance policy with server approval settings
  and owner capabilities. A2A contexts now descend from `PLURNK_A2A_PARENT_WORKER`
  (default `_plurnk`); `PLURNK_A2A_PROPOSALS` is retired. Schedule definitions no
  longer accept loop policy. Existing databases upgrade in place.

### Patch Changes

- 06960fc: Diagnostics across the stack say what happened, never why. A refusal names what
  was read, what was done with it and where, and recovers with the construct's
  working form; rebuilt scopes, suggested operations, presumed causes and
  migration hints for retired forms are gone.
- 85bcf56: Explain exhausted schedules as “no future occurrences” in their existing
  description, including when an absolute start has expired before add. Scheduling,
  delivery and WAIT behavior are unchanged.
- 503ea87: A `PLURNK_*` key the operator's configuration file sets and no installed package
  declares is named at startup and by `config check`; nothing is refused.
  Each package panel declares the key families it reads by computed name, such as
  `# PLURNK_MCP_<alias>=<definition>`.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Establish the coordinated 2.0 baseline and independent package versioning. From
  this release onward, each package follows its own SemVer contract; compatible
  unchanged dependencies no longer force synchronized releases. Library and
  extension dependencies declare compatible ranges, while the service records its
  assembled dependency selection. Exact tested compositions accompany releases.

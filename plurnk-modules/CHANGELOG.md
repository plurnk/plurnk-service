# @plurnk/plurnk-modules

## 4.0.0

- **Breaking:** daemon-wide action scope is `daemon`, replacing `world`.
  Update module declarations and consumers; no compatibility alias is retained.
- Functionality preparation receives host cancellation and reports aliases in
  flight. Shutdown joins activation, publication and cleanup before disposal;
  cancellation is not published as a failed resource.
- Uses contracts 4.0.

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 157cf8f: A members definition is its glob. `members (add)` takes `{"files": ["<glob>",
  "!<glob>"]}` and admits each glob as one definition, all or none, with a receipt
  listing them; `enable`, `disable` and `remove` take `{"file": "<glob>"}`; the
  family serves no `replace`. The operator's `PLURNK_MEMBERS_<alias>=<glob>` key
  is the definition's provenance, shown by `list`. Migration 27 re-keys workspace
  definitions by their glob and drops alias-keyed overrides of service
  definitions. The coordinator gains one seam, `addressing`: a family may name
  definitions by their content, `admit` may return one admission per definition,
  `FunctionalityPreparation.admissions` carries them, and
  `FunctionalityMutationResult` lists `definitions` for such an add. Every file
  miss recovery names the `members (add)` body the family accepts.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0b7f8b1: Add shared named definition replacement, retaining enabledness and preserving
  the previous publication on refusal. Use it for repeated environment EDITs
  and explicit child environment overrides, and reject fresh skill preparation
  failures when their definitions change. Carry attempt-local admission data
  through preparation without changing live state; schedule replacements and
  retries affect timers and held delivery failures only after publication.

### Patch Changes

- fc84b9a: Clarify ambient credential exclusion versus explicit MCP launch bindings through
  the existing approval path. Correct reserved-environment diagnostics and reference
  documentation without changing credential admission or adding configuration.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 69f3ffe: A family's `discover` advertises only the inputs it serves. An adapter declares
  `discovery.inputs` (and `emptyListsAll`), implements `discover` exactly when it
  does, and the coordinator builds the discover input schema from that
  declaration: any other input is refused 400 `arguments-invalid` by the shared
  schema check, naming the field. A family without discovery has no `discover`
  verb; MCP serves one only while `PLURNK_MCP_REGISTRY_URL` names a registry, and
  contains an invalid registry setting. Members discovery takes `query` alone and
  refuses a query naming no path or pattern as `query-invalid`; an empty env
  discovery is the whole catalog and needs no body. The refusals
  `query-unsupported`, `configuration-unsupported`, `source-unsupported`,
  `registry-not-configured`, `query-required` and schedule's `source-required`
  are gone.

### Patch Changes

- 85bcf56: Serve AG-UI only at `/agui`, removing the root endpoint. Clients must use the
  advertised URL or append `/agui` to the daemon origin. The HTTP root is available
  to an independent module; when unclaimed it returns 404 after startup. Rootless
  daemons retain the same startup-admission and mount-ownership checks.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Establish the coordinated 2.0 baseline and independent package versioning. From
  this release onward, each package follows its own SemVer contract; compatible
  unchanged dependencies no longer force synchronized releases. Library and
  extension dependencies declare compatible ranges, while the service records its
  assembled dependency selection. Exact tested compositions accompany releases.

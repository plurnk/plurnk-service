# @plurnk/plurnk-modules

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 69f3ffe: A family's `discover` advertises only the inputs it serves. An adapter declares
  `discovery.inputs` (and `emptyListsAll`), implements `discover` exactly when it
  does, and the coordinator builds the discover input schema from that
  declaration: any other input is refused 400 `arguments-invalid` by the shared
  schema check, naming the field. A family without discovery has no `discover`
  verb; MCP serves one only while `PLURNK_MCP_REGISTRY_URL` names a registry, and
  contains an invalid registry setting. Members discovery takes `query` alone and
  refuses a query naming no path or pattern as `query-invalid`; an empty env
  discovery is the whole catalog and needs no body. The refusals
  `query-unsupported`, `configuration-unsupported`, `source-unsupported`,
  `registry-not-configured`, `query-required` and schedule's `source-required`
  are gone.

### Patch Changes

- 85bcf56: Serve AG-UI only at `/agui`, removing the root endpoint. Clients must use the
  advertised URL or append `/agui` to the daemon origin. The HTTP root is available
  to an independent module; when unclaimed it returns 404 after startup. Rootless
  daemons retain the same startup-admission and mount-ownership checks.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Establish the coordinated 2.0 baseline and independent package versioning. From
  this release onward, each package follows its own SemVer contract; compatible
  unchanged dependencies no longer force synchronized releases. Library and
  extension dependencies declare compatible ranges, while the service records its
  assembled dependency selection. Exact tested compositions accompany releases.

# @plurnk/plurnk-parser

## 3.0.1

### Major Changes

- c053b24: Diagnostics say what happened, never why. An operation that takes no body names
  the lines it did not use instead of suggesting a pattern; a refused heading,
  scope or matcher carries the construct's working form instead of a rewrite of
  the input; advisories no longer name forms the parser did not apply.
- 85bcf56: Make parameterless KILL start the literal final-answer region. Everything after
  its heading belongs to the answer; an early closing fence can no longer discard
  the remainder or expose executable operations. Place operations before KILL.
  Targeted KILL and completion checks retain their existing behavior.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Establish the coordinated 2.0 baseline and independent package versioning. From
  this release onward, each package follows its own SemVer contract; compatible
  unchanged dependencies no longer force synchronized releases. Library and
  extension dependencies declare compatible ranges, while the service records its
  assembled dependency selection. Exact tested compositions accompany releases.

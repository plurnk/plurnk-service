# @plurnk/plurnk-execs

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8d9fb11: `ExecInfo.attribution` is removed; discovery's `packageAttributions` carries
  every package's tags.

### Patch Changes

- 06960fc: Diagnostics across the stack say what happened, never why. A refusal names what
  was read, what was done with it and where, and recovers with the construct's
  working form; rebuilt scopes, suggested operations, presumed causes and
  migration hints for retired forms are gone.
- f1bbc46: Offer the native `question` tool only to a worker whose owner would receive
  it: an interactive owner that declares the tool. Other workers do not see it
  at turn 0 or in the reserved reference set, and a call is refused with a
  recovery saying nobody is present to answer. The tool is on by default;
  `PLURNK_EXECS_QUESTION=0` remains the operator's switch to remove it.
  Teaching now says SEND carries progress updates and WAIT yields to children
  and streams, without changing either operation's behavior.
- 503ea87: A `PLURNK_*` key the operator's configuration file sets and no installed package
  declares is named at startup and by `config check`; nothing is refused.
  Each package panel declares the key families it reads by computed name, such as
  `# PLURNK_MCP_<alias>=<definition>`.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Establish the coordinated 2.0 baseline and independent package versioning. From
  this release onward, each package follows its own SemVer contract; compatible
  unchanged dependencies no longer force synchronized releases. Library and
  extension dependencies declare compatible ranges, while the service records its
  assembled dependency selection. Exact tested compositions accompany releases.

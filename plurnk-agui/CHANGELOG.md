# @plurnk/plurnk-agui

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 85bcf56: Serve AG-UI only at `/agui`, removing the root endpoint. Clients must use the
  advertised URL or append `/agui` to the daemon origin. The HTTP root is available
  to an independent module; when unclaimed it returns 404 after startup. Rootless
  daemons retain the same startup-admission and mount-ownership checks.
- 85bcf56: Bind worker approvals to durable owners, inherited by child workers. Client
  attachments declare their supported interaction tools; reconnecting owners can
  resume pending approvals. Explicit control attachment may claim runtime-owned
  work but does not silently transfer another client's ownership.
  
  Replace per-loop proposal and attendance policy with server approval settings
  and owner capabilities. A2A contexts now descend from `PLURNK_A2A_PARENT_WORKER`
  (default `_plurnk`); `PLURNK_A2A_PROPOSALS` is retired. Schedule definitions no
  longer accept loop policy. Existing databases upgrade in place.

### Patch Changes

- 8d9fb11: Retired names, settings and shapes are erased; nothing recognizes them to refuse
  or translate them. A setting the package does not read is inert, and an
  undeclared value fails through the package's ordinary check.
- 4153042: An owner declares whether a person attends it (`interactive`), beside the
  client tools it implements. A provider-recovery park and a clarification need
  an interactive owner; approval does not, so an automatically approving client
  that nobody attends concludes on a provider failure instead of parking. AG-UI
  reads `forwardedProps.plurnk.interactive`; unstated, nobody attends.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Establish the coordinated 2.0 baseline and independent package versioning. From
  this release onward, each package follows its own SemVer contract; compatible
  unchanged dependencies no longer force synchronized releases. Library and
  extension dependencies declare compatible ranges, while the service records its
  assembled dependency selection. Exact tested compositions accompany releases.

# @plurnk/plurnk-providers

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8d9fb11: `RequestFields.rejectRetired` is removed. The providers package reads only its
  declared keys; it names no other key to refuse it.
- 06960fc: The provider notice `grammar_unenforced` is now `output_unaccounted`, and its
  message states the two counts: the output tokens billed and the tokens visible
  across content and reasoning.

### Patch Changes

- 85bcf56: Pin the AI SDK runtime and provider adapters to the verified dependency
  versions, preserving the tested SDK selection in fresh consumer installs.
- 503ea87: A `PLURNK_*` key the operator's configuration file sets and no installed package
  declares is named at startup and by `config check`; nothing is refused.
  Each package panel declares the key families it reads by computed name, such as
  `# PLURNK_MCP_<alias>=<definition>`.
- 85bcf56: Bind worker approvals to durable owners, inherited by child workers. Client
  attachments declare their supported interaction tools; reconnecting owners can
  resume pending approvals. Explicit control attachment may claim runtime-owned
  work but does not silently transfer another client's ownership.
  
  Replace per-loop proposal and attendance policy with server approval settings
  and owner capabilities. A2A contexts now descend from `PLURNK_A2A_PARENT_WORKER`
  (default `_plurnk`); `PLURNK_A2A_PROPOSALS` is retired. Schedule definitions no
  longer accept loop policy. Existing databases upgrade in place.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Establish the coordinated 2.0 baseline and independent package versioning. From
  this release onward, each package follows its own SemVer contract; compatible
  unchanged dependencies no longer force synchronized releases. Library and
  extension dependencies declare compatible ranges, while the service records its
  assembled dependency selection. Exact tested compositions accompany releases.
